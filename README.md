## Quick Start
This platform is currently in an beta version so at the moment there
isn't anyway to start right away.

### For Developers
1. Download this repository.
2. Go into the folder "Arduino" and upload the Code on an Arduino Mega.
3. Go into the folder "App" and run `npm install`.
4. Start the Software with `npm start`.

## Status
This project is still in progress, so some features are missing. However, you
can already use it.

## Communication
Documentation for the communication will come soon.

## Software
!["Picture of Software"](Images/software.png)
The Software is build with Electron, therefore it runs on macOS, Windows and
Linux. Currently it can only communicate with the Ardunio over USB.

## Hardware
Documentation for the hardware will come soon.
